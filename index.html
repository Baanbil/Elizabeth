    <h2>Dear Elizabeth,</h2>
    <p>
      It's hard to believe that it's been two years since we last saw each other. Time has flown by, but the memories we shared are still fresh in my mind. I often think about the moments we laughed together and even the little disagreements that only made our bond stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      I miss you more than words can express. Our friendship meant the world to me, and it still does. Life has taken us on different paths, but I hope we can find our way back to each other. I truly value the connection we had, and I regret any hurtful words or actions that came between us.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope you're doing well and finding happiness in whatever you're doing. I would love to catch up and hear all about your adventures and experiences over the past two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take care and know that you are always in my thoughts.
      With warmest regards,<br>
      Baanbil
